The kinetic energy (E) of a body is equal to its enhanced relativistic mass (m) times the speed of light squared (c²) in the equation, where the speed of light is 3x10⁸m/s`,

        "Relativistic effects can be observed if we combine time dilation and length contraction. In this scenario, you must compute the velocity using the formula  u = (v+w) / (1+(v * w)/c²). When the speed of the spacecraft or the projectile is less than the speed of light, the formula becomes u = v + w, which is the total of the velocities. If the velocities v and w are both high, the projectile's speed as perceived from outside the spacecraft is substantially lower than the sum of the two speeds v + w and never reaches the speed of light.",

You can presumably see (or have already learned from playing with our time dilation calculator) that the observer speed must be extraordinarily high - on the same order of magnitude as the speed of light - for the difference in the two time spans to be evident. That is why relativistic effects are so perplexing: we cannot observe them in ordinary life.",

The speed must be very high - equivalent to the speed of light - for the impact of length contraction to be evident. We have no experience with items travelling at such high speeds in our daily lives. As a result, the implications of special relativity are quite perplexing.",
      formula: "Relative Length = L * √(1 - v²/c²)",
      process:
        "Because, in addition to the great speed required, measuring the length of an item moving with regard to us is difficult, the consequences of length contraction are difficult to perceive. To find the length contraction we need to know the value of length (L) and speed of object (v) where  the value of speed of light is 3x10⁸m/s",
