        "The Rydberg formula describes the various transition energies that occur between energy levels. A photon is released when an electron goes from a higher to a lower energy level. Depending on the beginning and ultimate energy levels of the transition, the hydrogen atom can produce different wavelengths of light. It emits a photon with an energy equal to the square of the energy levels of the final (nf) and initial (ni).",

A photon of energy hv is absorbed by the electron of the metal surface, then the energy is used to liberate the electron from the surface and rest of the energy becomes the kinetic energy of the electron.",
      process:
        "So The Energy(E) of a photon can be obtained by using the work function(φ) and the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons from the metal surface. Where E is the incident energy of photons with the formula E=hv and h represents the Planck constant, v represents the frequency of incident radiation, 'φ' is the work function of metal and 'KEₘₐₓ' is the maximum kinetic energy of electrons.",

The kinetic energy of the electron is given by K.E=mvₙ²/2. The potential energy is given by P.E=-Ze²/4πε₀rₙ.So, Total energy of an electron can be calculated by using the following Bohr's formula",
      process:
        "An electron make jumps between the orbits around the nucleus according to the amount of energy that they have.When they jump from lower orbit to higher orbit they absorb energy, and they lose energy when they jump from higher orbit to lower orbit.
